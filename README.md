# Escape-The-Room-Game
This project was developed as a final assignment for the Topics in Complex Large Scale Systems course. The goal was to create a 2D role-playing game using Appleâ€™s SpriteKit framework in Swift.  In this dungeon escape RPG, the player is trapped in a small room and must find a way to escape.
